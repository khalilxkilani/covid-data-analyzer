# COVID-19 Data Analyzer
I worked with the COVID-19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. In addition, I used another dataset consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy the people living in that country are.

This project was created in the course COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python on Coursera.
